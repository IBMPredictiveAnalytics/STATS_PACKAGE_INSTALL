<h1>STATS PACKAGE INSTALL Extension Command</h1>
<div class="syntax">
<p></p>Install Python and R packages needed by  extension commands and programs but not installed with them</p>

<p>STATS PACKAGE INSTALL<br/>
PYTHON = list of Python packages to install from PyPI<br/>
R = list of R packages to install from CRAN<br/>
</p>

<p>/HELP</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>
</div>
<p>STATS PACKAGE INSTALL /HELP prints this help and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>
STATS PACKAGE INSTALL PYTHON=nltk R=class AER.
</code></pre>

<p>R CRAN packages needed by an R extension command are normally installed automatically when an extension
is installed if an Internet connection is available, but sometimes a package dependency is not specified by the
package author or a newer version may be needed.  For Python, packages needed from PyPI are currently not
installed automatically with the extension command.</p>

<p>Note that on some systems, this command requires that Statistics be started in administrator mode.</p>

<p><strong>PYTHON</strong> specifies one or more Python packages to install from PyPI.
The letter case of the names does not matter.  If the current version of a package is already installed,
it will be skipped.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> specifies one or more R packages to install from CRAN.
The letter case must match the case of the name.  The install will overwrite
an existing package with the same name.
</p>

<p>Python packages are installed by the Python PIP utility via the SPSS Statistics HOST command.  R packages
are installed by the R install.packages function using a BEGIN PROGRAM R block.</p>

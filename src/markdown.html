<h1>STATS PACKAGE INSTALL Extension Command</h1>
<div class="syntax">
<p></p>Install Python and R packages needed by  extension commands and programs but not installed with them</p>

<p>STATS PACKAGE INSTALL /HELP prints this help and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>
STATS PACKAGE INSTALL PYTHON=nltk R=class AER.
</code></pre>

<pre class="example"><code>
STATS PACKAGE INSTALL PYTHON=nltk abc xyz "*" "1,2,3" "<=3.3".
</code></pre>

<p>R CRAN packages needed by an R extension command are normally installed automatically when an extension
is installed if an Internet connection is available, but sometimes a package dependency is not specified by the
package author or a newer version may be needed.  For Python, packages needed from PyPI are currently not
installed automatically with the extension command.</p>

<p>Note that on some systems, this command requires that Statistics be started in administrator mode.</p>

<p><strong>PYTHON</strong> specifies one or more Python packages to install from PyPI.
The letter case of the names does not matter.  If the current version of a package is already installed,
it will be skipped.</p>
<strong>package versions</strong> By default, the latest version of a package is installed.  To install
a specific version, list the version number in quotes.  If any version specifications are used, versions
must be listed for all in the order in which the package names are listed.  Use * to indicate the latest version.</p>
<p>Version numbers can also be specified with an inequality indicated by &lt;, &lt;=, >, or >= e.g. "<2.0.0"
<p>There is currently no way to specify specific versions for R packages with this command.<p>


<p><strong>R</strong> specifies one or more R packages to install from CRAN.
The letter case must match the case of the name.  The install will overwrite
an existing package with the same name.
</p>
<strong>/UNINSTALL PYTHON</strong> List the packages to be removed.  Removals take place before
any installs are done.  If a package has been used in the current session, it may be necessary to
restart SPSS Statistics before the package can be removed.  Python itself is not removed.</p>

<p>Python packages are installed and removed by the Python PIP utility via the SPSS Statistics HOST command.  R packages
are installed by the R install.packages function using a BEGIN PROGRAM R block.</p>
